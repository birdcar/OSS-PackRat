# The OSS PackRat Code of Conduct

## 1. Overview

OSS PackRat is a free and open tool managed by Erik Whiting. Development and management is completely voluntarily and in good faith with the intention to improve the state of research in software engineering and computer science. As a primarily academic tool, we are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants agree to abide by this Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form of behavior to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct.

You can contact Erik by emailing [erik@erikwhiting.com](mailto:erik@erikwhiting.com). Erik is responsible for reviewing and keeping confidentiality of all incident reports when enforcing the Code of Conduct.
